# XcodeGen
#
# It's common to ignore the .xcodeproj itself if using XcodeGen
# but since the user asked for xcodegen config, I'll ignore the project file
# as it can be regenerated.
# However, many developers prefer to keep it. 
# Looking at the previous steps, the user wanted to "add xcodegen config".
# I'll include standard Xcode ignores.
